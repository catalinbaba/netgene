Genetic Algorithms and Neural Network Java Library


<b>Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network Library</b>
Welcome to our Genetic Algorithm and Neural Network Library for Java! This robust library is designed to offer an integrated solution for simulations that leverage both genetic algorithms (GAs) and neural networks (NNs).

Features
Gene Classes: At the core of our genetic algorithm implementation, the Gene classes represent individual genes. These classes are flexible and can be customized to represent various genetic traits within the context of your specific problem.

Chromosome Representation: Chromosomes, composed of multiple genes, are crucial in representing potential solutions. Each Chromosome object in our library can be manipulated and evaluated, acting as a fundamental unit of genetic structure.

Individual Entities: Each Chromosome can be part of an Individual, which represents a single entity in the population. Individuals undergo evaluation, selection, and breeding to evolve the population towards optimal solutions.

This library is perfect for anyone looking to explore the potential of genetic algorithms combined with the adaptive capabilities of neural networks in Java. Whether for academic research, simulation modeling, or complex optimization problems, our library provides a foundational structure to build upon.

Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the README. The library is structured to be intuitive and includes examples to help you implement your first GA and NN models.

Happy coding!
